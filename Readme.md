The established design is not exactly the same as the one proposed by the exercise but it uses the techniques of flex-box, paddings, margins with so many by the way to give it a responsive effect and styles of color and text.

I hope that it comes as close as possible to the desired one, I have not been able to apply the images either, but I will try to find some that fit the design.

Cheers!
